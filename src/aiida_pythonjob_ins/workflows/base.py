"""Abstract base WorkChains, one per reusable feature.

Two independent features are split into two abstract bases so that a workflow
inherits only what it needs:

* :class:`JobDispatchWorkChain` -- the ``code``/``options`` dispatch plumbing
  (inputs, ``get_job_metadata()`` and the ``400 ERROR_SUB_PROCESS_FAILED`` exit
  code) shared by every workflow that runs PythonJobs.
* :class:`FromForceConstantsWorkChain` -- obtaining force constants by running
  :class:`~aiida_pythonjob_ins.workflows.force_constants.ForceConstantsWorkChain`
  as a sub-workflow, exposing its inputs under a ``force_constants`` namespace
  (Decision 1) and reporting its failure with ``402
  ERROR_SUB_PROCESS_FAILED_FORCE_CONSTANTS``.

Each base subclasses ``WorkChain`` directly (rather than being a plain mixin) so
its spec can be built and tested on its own, and neither references the other's
ports, methods or exit codes. Neither has an outline: consumers add their own,
starting ``cls.run_force_constants, cls.inspect_force_constants, ...`` where
they use the force-constants source. Plumpy's method resolution order builds one
spec through every base when a consumer subclasses several, provided each base's
``define`` calls ``super().define(spec)``.
